=================================
An open-source tetrode twister for Arduino
=================================

This code requires the `Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc>`_ development environment and an `Arduino board <http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021>`_. 

The code has been updated to be compatible with the Arduino IDE version 1.0 and higher. To make it compatible with earlier versions of the IDE, simply include "WProgram.h" instead of "Arduino.h" in the TwisterClasses.h file.

This repository contains circuit board files, a parts list, and an instruction manual.
